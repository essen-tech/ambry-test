# Block

A block is usually a component that is reused by specific sections.
An example:
You have two sections

- NewsSection (Shows all news items from backend)
- LatestNewsSection (Shows only the 5 latest news items)

You would then create a NewsItemBlock which will be reused by both above sections and in turn will render
every news item.
